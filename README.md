<p align="center">Re-encode Cardano token registry metadata</br></p>

The token registry operated by Cardano Foundation and hosted at [tokens.cardano.org](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) is rate-limited but sadly there is no way to mirror the registry in a hosted manner. This tools allows you to convert the content of the registry repository into files for direct consumption. 

## Usage

`$ metadada-convert-dir inDir outDir`
